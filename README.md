## 🙋‍♂️Hello, I'm martincodes alias Martin
- 👨‍💻 I'm a software engineer in training and dual student of computer science based in Berlin, Germany.
- 🎓 Currently I make my hobby my profession. My goal is to become a good software engineer.
- 🚲 In my free time besides programming, I meet with friends, ride my bike, or go to the gym to exercise.
  - ⌛ However, due to the dual study program, this time is very rare.
- 🧑🏻‍💻 I like to program software and tools that people use. That's what gives me the most pleasure.
- 🆒 I contribute actively to open source. At this moment, I'm working on [foodsharing](https://foodsharing.de), a platform and community against food waste with more than 500k people.
- 🛠️ Besides my main tech stack, I also try out different programming languages and tools. The best way for me to do this is through a small/middle sized project.
  - 🖥️ I am currently most interested in web, backend and some app development.
